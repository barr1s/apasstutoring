*** JavaScript Basics ***

JS enables us to implement code logic into html 
This makes it easy to implement backend and more complex
user interactions with the website. However, CSS has been
becoming more powerful making it easier to animate in CSS 
VS JS. That's why for the time being I will be using JS 
handling backend services to this website 

Useful Functions:

* document.getElementById(<id from html>)

This listens to the html code and when a certain event id 
triggered it forwards the id to JS

* Example1 
const submitButton = document.getElementById("submit");
the constant submitButton is being assinged to the "submit" id
of the submit button in HTML. 
NONONO
The real explanation is, when this line of code is executed,
it searches the entire html document and looks for the ID of 
arguement. I mean it's kinda the same thing. But this code LINKS
html and JS tightly 

submitButton.addEventListener("click", async (event) => {
This is the code that determines how to react when an event is 
triggered.
